# uHDF5: minimalistic C++ API for working with HDF5 files

## Goals

1. Make working with HDF5 easier and less verbose, compared to using the official HDF5 C or C++ API
2. Only support every-day operations well, don't try to cover the whole gamut of HDF5 possibilities
3. Expose as little of the underlying HDF5 library as possible
4. Allow to use native C++ types and idioms (like uint8_t, float, double, std::vector)

## Example

See included t_uhdf5.cpp
